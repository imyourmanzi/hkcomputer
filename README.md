# HomeKit Computer

Tired of not having enough smart devices to automate with HomeKit?  Look no further because this project turns your (arguably) smartest device into a HomeKit accessory: your computer!

This project builds a daemon that runs on your personal computer to make it visible to HomeKit-enabled services.
